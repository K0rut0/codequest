# Problem: Sorting Numbers

## Problem Statement

You are given a list of **N** integers. Your task is to sort the numbers in non-decreasing order.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
- -10^9 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **N**, denoting the number of elements in the list.

The second line contains **N** space-separated integers **A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]**, representing the elements of the list.

## Output

Output the sorted list in non-decreasing order.

## Example

### Input

5
2 5 1 9 3

### Output

1 2 3 5 9

## Explanation

The given list [2, 5, 1, 9, 3] is sorted in non-decreasing order to obtain [1, 2, 3, 5, 9].
